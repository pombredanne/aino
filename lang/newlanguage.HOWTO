How to add support for a new language, including stemming and language detection?

1. Reserve a new language symbol and code in ixemes.h (e.g. LANG_SW 599)
2. Add Snowball stemming source to stems/LANG_SW.sbl.
3. Add TextCat language model to lm/lm_LANG_SW.lm.
4. Do scons at the root level

5. (optional) Try "./test_LANG_SW fubar" to see that stemming works ok.

That's it.

Note that the file names must follow strictly the above naming convention.
